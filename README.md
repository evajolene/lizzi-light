# LizziLight

LizziLight is a collection of shaders for the Unity engine that generates a flat lighting mask to create seamless intersection of lights.

## Before You Use LizziLight

If you'd like to use the shaders, please credit me in your project as Eva Jolene. I would also appreciate a donation if you like using it, but it's not required! You can donate here: https://www.paypal.me/evajolene

## Effects

Multiply shader: it's the standard post effect using LizziLight. Multiplies a given color with the texture if there's light.
